Welcome to Athenry  <%= "#{Athenry::Version::STRING}" %>!  This is the help utility.

If this is your first time using the Athenry shell you should check out
the Quickstart guide at http://gregf.github.com/athenry/docs/quickstart/

Enter the name of the command you want to run and the shell will run it.

Typing debug will show some additional output if you are having issues,
typing it again will disable it.

Hitting [tab] twice will show you a list of commands available, this shell
is fully readline compatible. All typical shell key commands should work.
