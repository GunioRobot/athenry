<p>Why Athenry when there are already two other rather mature tools available, <a href='http://github.com/funtoo/metro/tree/master'>Metro</a> and <a href='http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst/'>Catalyst</a>. Each of these tools do fine jobs, and continue to do the job the devs want in producing usable stage tarballs. Athenry does not try to be Catalyst or Metro. With previous attempts to use both tools, it became obvious that there are advantages, and short comings for both tools. Athenry was created in an attempt to take the best from both Metro and Catalyst, and leaving behind anything that makes it more difficult to create any stage tarballs that are needed. Athenry allows the ability to resume from any point of failure, instead of having to start all over again from scratch. Athenry is package manager agnostic. Use the package manager of your choice. This is discussed more in depth below. Atherny starts with a chroot just like what would have to be done manually with other tools before beginning. A stage tarball is downloaded if not already present, and the files extracted. Athenry&#8217;s configuration files are pulled into the chroot. You are free to use the config files as is, or tweak and edit until your fingers are sore. Now that Athenry has the information it needs, it will go through the steps needed to produce a working chroot or stage tarball of your choice, built to your exacting specifications. If after examining Athenry&#8217;s output, and everything is exactly what was expected, Athenry can now create as many chroot&#8217;s or stage tarballs as needed without further modification.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons for writing Athenry was neither Catalyst nor Metro allowed a package manager beside emerge to be used. As the ever increasing number of <a href='http://paludis.pioto.org/'>Paludis</a> users grow, the need for a system to easily build chroots and stage tarballs using their package manager of choice also increases. Athenry has been written with the idea of staying package manager agnostic in mind. Currently, there is support for emerge and paludis out of the box. None of Athenry&#8217;s devs use <a href='http://www.pkgcore.org/trac/pkgcore'>pkgcore</a>, or support for pkgcore would be included as well. Adding pkgcore support should be a trivial task if someone was interested enough to do the testing.</p>

<p>There weren&#8217;t any benefits, besides the &#8220;coolness&#8221; factor, in moving all configuration into a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language'>DSL</a>, when most of us have already spent a great deal of time building, tweaking and perfecting configuration files. The decision in building the stages in a chroot allows easy recovery in the event Athenry is having issues building a stage for some reason. Once the error is discovered one can simply chroot into the stage building environment, fix any errors encountered, log out and then let Athenry continue from that point like nothing even happened. Something both catalyst and metro have neglected.</p>

<p>Athenry is currently at a very early stage of development, and It is not recommend that most people play with it just yet. If you are curious, or find it useful feel free to try. Large chunks of code are ugly and are going to be refactored. There is also a great deal of missing functionality that is coming with each release. The point of releasing Athenry now is to get some people using it that can hopefully handle any potential bugs and to receive feedback.</p>

<p>The Athenry team has the utmost respect for the <a href='http://www.gentoo.org'>Gentoo</a> and <a href='http://www.funtoo.org'>Funtoo</a> teams. We are however unhappy with how existing tools work now. We hope everyone enjoys Athenry, but if no one else but the team finds it usefull it, is still worth the effort in the end.</p></div></div>
